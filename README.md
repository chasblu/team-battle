###Technologies Used:
- HTML 
- CSS: Flexbox 
- Javascript: Classes, DOM elements, Math methods, event listeners, callback functions 

###Lessons/Ongoing issues 
- At first I wanted the project to be a team battle game where you and the computer select your team in a draft format and then battle it out.
- I realized that when building a game its important to stay focused on one thing at a time in order not to get overwhelmed 
- Write ideas down and file them away you can always go back to them

###unsolved Problems
- Making it so that the user and computer select a team of 3 to battle each other
- Making different attack for the characters that do different damage and use different amounts of energy so that there is a strategy involved
- Add animations for attacks and effects to the characters when they are hit to show the fight instead of dialogue
